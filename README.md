# surfs_up

Overview:

  The purpose of this analysis is to determine if Oahu is the best location for a surf/ice cream shop. This is done by analyzing the weather patterns of Oahu. I pulled weather data from a SQLLite database. We were especially interested in temperature data, as warm temperatures logically help ice cream sales.

Results:

  1) Oahu does not fluctuate terribly in temperature during each month. July and December appear to have good temperatures for surfing

  2) Oahu does not get so hot that no one would want to be outside. The max temperature during June was 85 degrees.
  3) Oahu does not get too cold. The minimum temperature during December was 56 degrees.


Summary:

  1) I would create another dataframe for all 12 months to view temperature data
  2) I would create a query to find lightning data. Rain doesn't necessarily stop surfing.
  3) I would also start market research to find if there are any major competitors
